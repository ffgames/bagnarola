Distributed remake of the "Carcassonne" board game

## running the game
Before you run the game you need to start a Lobby server by running the lobby.jar file right for your java installation and then you can connect to that lobby from the main menu.
To start the game, run the game.jar correct file and specify an unique username and the network location of the lobby server to which you want to connect to (localhost if you are running a lobby on your host machine)

## troubleshooting
If the game is not starting you probably need to recreate the symbolic links to res/ and lib/ folders into the build/java_X.Y.Z/ directory from where you run the game
